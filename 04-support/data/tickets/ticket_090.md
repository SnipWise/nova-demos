# Incorrect Billing for Premium Subscription

**Severity:** MEDIUM

## Description

I subscribed to the Premium plan on March 15th, 2024, which should cost $14.99/month according to your website. However, I was charged $19.99 on March 15th and again on April 15th. I checked my account settings and it shows I'm on the Premium plan, but the billing amount doesn't match. I've contacted customer support via chat but haven't received a response. I need this resolved as I'm being overcharged. My account number is 12345678 and the transaction IDs are TXN-ABC123 and TXN-DEF456.
