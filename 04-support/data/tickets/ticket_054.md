# Content Availability Inconsistency Across Regions

**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Description

I have a subscription and I'm currently traveling. When I was in the United States, I could watch 'The Complete Collection' series. Now that I'm in Europe (France), the same series shows as 'Not available in your region' even though I'm using the same account and subscription. I understand there might be licensing restrictions, but this is frustrating as I was in the middle of watching Season 2. Additionally, some movies that were available in the US are now unavailable here, while some European content that wasn't available in the US is now showing up. There's no clear indication of what content is available where, and the changes happen without notice. I'd like to know if there's a way to see what content will be available before I travel, or if there's a workaround for this issue.
