# Search Functionality Broken for Non-English Titles

**Severity:** MEDIUM

## Description

Your search feature doesn't work properly for movies and shows with non-English titles. For example, when I search for 'Amélie' (the French film), nothing comes up. When I search for 'Parasite' (the Korean film), I get results for an American TV show with the same name, but not the actual Korean movie. I've tried searching in multiple languages and using different search terms, but foreign language content is not being returned in search results. However, if I browse the 'International' category, I can find these titles. This suggests the content is in your catalog, but the search indexing is broken for non-English titles. This makes it very difficult to find international content.
