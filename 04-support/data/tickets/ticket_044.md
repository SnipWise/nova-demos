# Chromecast Disconnection During Playback

**Severity:** HIGH

## Description

I'm trying to cast content from my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S21) to a Chromecast Ultra connected to my TV. The casting starts successfully and the video begins playing, but after approximately 10-15 minutes, the connection drops and I get a 'Connection lost' error message. This happens consistently with every piece of content I try to watch. My phone and Chromecast are on the same WiFi network (5GHz band). I've tried restarting both devices, updating the Google Home app, and even resetting the Chromecast, but the issue continues. The same phone can cast to the Chromecast from YouTube and Netflix without any problems. This started happening after I updated your app to version 3.2.0 last week.
