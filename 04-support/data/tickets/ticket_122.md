# Playback Error Code 5001 on iOS App

**Severity:** HIGH

## Description

I'm experiencing a persistent playback error on the iOS app (version 2.4.1) on my iPhone 13 Pro running iOS 17.2. When I try to play any content, I get error code 5001 and the message 'Playback failed. Please try again.' This happens with both downloaded and streamed content. I've tried: uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, clearing app data, updating to the latest iOS version, and switching between WiFi and cellular data. Nothing works. The web version works fine on the same device using Safari. This started happening after the last app update (2.4.1) which I installed 5 days ago. I've checked the App Store reviews and several other users are reporting the same issue.
