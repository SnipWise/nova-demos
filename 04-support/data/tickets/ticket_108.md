# Payment Method Update Causing Subscription Cancellation

**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Description

My credit card expired last month, so I updated my payment method through the account settings. I entered my new card details (Visa ending in 4567) and received a confirmation that the payment method was updated successfully. However, two days later, I received an email saying my subscription was cancelled due to payment failure. When I log into my account, it shows 'Subscription Cancelled' even though I have a valid payment method on file. I've tried updating the payment method again, but the system won't let me reactivate my subscription. I need immediate assistance as I'm losing access to content I've already paid for.
