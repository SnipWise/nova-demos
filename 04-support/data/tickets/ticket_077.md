# Incorrect Movie Metadata and Wrong Poster

**Severity:** LOW

## Description

The movie 'Midnight Shadows' (2023) in your catalog has incorrect information. The poster image shows a different movie (looks like a horror film), but when I play it, it's actually a romantic comedy. The description also doesn't match - it describes a thriller plot, but the actual movie is a light-hearted comedy. Additionally, the cast list is wrong - it shows actors who aren't in the movie at all. I've checked IMDb and other sources, and the correct information should be: Director: Sarah Johnson, Cast: Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Genre: Romantic Comedy, Release Date: March 2023. This is confusing and misleading for users trying to decide what to watch.
