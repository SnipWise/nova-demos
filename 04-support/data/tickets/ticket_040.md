# Recommendation Algorithm Showing Irrelevant Content

**Severity:** HIGH

## Description

The 'Recommended for You' section on my homepage is completely off-base. I primarily watch action movies and sci-fi series, but my recommendations are filled with romantic comedies, cooking shows, and children's content. I've tried rating content I like and dislike, and I've cleared my watch history and started fresh, but the recommendations don't improve. I've been a subscriber for 6 months and have watched over 50 titles, so there should be enough data for accurate recommendations. The 'Trending' and 'Popular' sections show content that matches my interests, so I know the content exists. It seems like the recommendation algorithm isn't working properly for my account.
