# Constant Buffering on 4K Content Despite High-Speed Internet

**Severity:** LOW

## Description

I have a 500 Mbps fiber internet connection and can stream 4K content from other services without any issues. However, when I try to watch 4K content on your platform, it constantly buffers every 30-60 seconds. The video will play smoothly for a bit, then pause to buffer, play again, and repeat this cycle. I've tested this on multiple devices: Samsung Smart TV (2022 model), Apple TV 4K, and my Windows PC using Chrome browser. The issue occurs on all devices. I've checked my network speed using speedtest.net and consistently get 480-520 Mbps download speeds. Other streaming services work perfectly. I've tried clearing the app cache, restarting my router, and even connecting directly via ethernet cable, but the problem persists. This has been happening for the past 2 weeks. My account shows I'm on the Premium 4K plan.
