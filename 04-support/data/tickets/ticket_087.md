# Family Plan Member Addition Not Working

**Severity:** LOW

## Description

I have a Family plan subscription that allows up to 5 profiles. Currently, I have 3 profiles set up (mine, my spouse's, and my daughter's). When I try to add my son's profile, I click 'Add Profile' and fill in his name and age, but after clicking 'Save', nothing happens. The page doesn't refresh and the profile doesn't appear in the list. I've tried this on both the web app and mobile app (iOS). I've cleared my browser cache and cookies, and also tried incognito mode, but the issue persists. This has been happening for about a week now.
