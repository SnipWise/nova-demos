# Missing Episodes in Season 3 of Popular Series

**Severity:** HIGH

## Description

I'm trying to watch Season 3 of 'The Chronicles of Avalon' which your platform advertises as having all 12 episodes available. However, when I navigate to Season 3, I can only see episodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Episodes 4 and 8 are completely missing from the episode list. I've checked on both the web interface and mobile app, and the issue is consistent across both platforms. I've also checked from different accounts (my own and a friend's) and the same episodes are missing. The series page shows 'All episodes available' but this is clearly not the case. I've been waiting for these episodes to appear for over a week now. This is frustrating as I'm in the middle of watching the season and the missing episodes break the continuity of the story.
