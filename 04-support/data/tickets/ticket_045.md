# Account Access Issues After Email Change

**Severity:** HIGH

## Description

I recently changed my email address from oldemail@example.com to newemail@example.com. The change was confirmed via email, but now I cannot log in with either the old or new email address. When I try to reset my password, I receive the reset link but after clicking it, I get an error message saying 'Invalid token' or 'Link expired'. I've tried this multiple times over the past 3 days. I'm using Chrome browser on Windows 10. My subscription is active and I can see charges on my credit card statement. Please help me regain access to my account.
