# Download Fails at 99% Completion

**Severity:** MEDIUM

## Description

I'm trying to download episodes of a series for offline viewing before a long flight. The download starts normally and progresses to 99%, but then it stops and shows 'Download failed. Please try again.' I've tried downloading individual episodes and entire seasons, but the same issue occurs. I have 15GB of free storage on my device (iPad Pro 12.9-inch, 256GB model). I've tried: clearing app cache, restarting the device, deleting other apps to free up space, downloading over both WiFi and cellular, and even factory resetting the app. The issue persists. I've successfully downloaded content from this app before, so I know it's not a device issue. This is preventing me from watching content during my flight.
