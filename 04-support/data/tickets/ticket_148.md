# Audio Sync Issues on Roku Device

**Severity:** LOW

## Description

I'm watching content on a Roku Ultra (model 4800) connected to a Samsung QLED TV. The audio is consistently out of sync with the video - the audio is about 1-2 seconds ahead of the video. This happens with all content, both live and on-demand. I've tried adjusting the audio delay settings on my TV and soundbar, but that doesn't help because the issue is specific to your app. Other streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu) work perfectly with correct audio sync. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, updating the Roku firmware, and even factory resetting the Roku device, but the problem persists. The issue started about 3 weeks ago after a Roku system update. I've reported this through the app feedback but haven't heard back.
